# Work-Day-Planner
## As a user with a busy schedule, we want an app that will allow us to jot down appointments that we have for that day.

The starter code contained information that we could use to model our schedule. We wanted each slot to be color coded depending on what time of the day it was to indicate past, present or future. 

For this I created a function that involved each timeBlock class (this was in the text area portion where the used would write their appointments). 

In this function I created an if statement in which I would compare the time given with the actual realtime. 

* In order to do this I first created a "time" variable and gave it a value of moment.hours.
